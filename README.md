# LUM
Choose a matrix size, then input it's data. Press "Decompose" to decompose the given matrix M
into a pair L,U such that M = LU, when L is lower triangular and U is upper triangular.
Checking the "PLU decomposition" option allows moving rows in M to ensure it has such a decomposition.
The P matrix is the row shift matrix, and the decomposition is such that PM=LU.

Special thanks to:
jQuery
math.js - awesome library, very useful matrix functions
TodoMVC - used some CSS
João Sardinha - used some of his table CSS
